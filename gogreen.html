            <p>  Gas engines like your lawnmower and weed wacker may be small, but they have big effects on air quality. For example, using a gas-powered lawnmower for one hour will produce the same amount of emissions as driving your car 64 miles!  Switching to an electric mower will reduce your emissions to zero. If you’re not able to give up your gas engine, cutting less frequently and mulching grass clippings are a great way to reduce the impact.</p>

        <p>   Staying hydrated is especially important when out in the heat of the summer. But staying healthy doesn’t have to come at an environmental cost. One of the simplest ways to make a difference is to swap your plastic bottle for a reusable one. Creating a single liter plastic water bottle requires at least 6 liters of water to produce. Not only will you help to conserve water you will also help limit the number of plastic bottles that flood landfills.</p>

    <p>       You already know water conservation is essential, especially in Utah, but here is another lesser-known way you can help. Rain barrels are a fantastic rainwater collector that can then be used to water your gardens during times of drought. Organizations like Utah Rivers Council run awesome initiatives like this discounted rain barrel program to help make water conservation easier for Salt Lake County residents.</p>

    <h3>4.Natural Energy</h3>

    <p>   Electricity fuels our air conditioners, lamps and appliances — all household commodities that are pretty nice to have around. Cranking up the air conditioner is tempting when the heat rises. A great way to save energy, and money, is to opt for a fan instead. Or, try to limit use during the hottest part of the day. Another great way to conserve energy is to use natural sunlight instead of interior lights and let the sun dry your clothes instead of putting them in the dryer.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>5.Volunteer</h3>

    <p>   Time is valuable, which is why it’s one of the most important ways you can help your community go green. Volunteering for organizations that protect our parks, people and the environment will keep Utah healthy, safe and green. Whether it’s cleaning up a public space or helping to grow healthy food for those in need, whatever your interest, there’s a program in Utah that could use your time and expertise.</p>
