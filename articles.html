        <h2>Plastic Water Bottle EnvirOnmental Impacts.</h2>
        <p>Water is as essential to humans as air. Having clean drinkable water available at all times, wherever we are, is vital. For this reason, the most used container is the plastic bottle. The world buys a million plastic bottles every minute. People who do not have drinkable water running in their home pipes often turn to one option; bottled water.</p>
        <h2>What Are The Plastic Bottle Made Of?</h2>
        <p>Manufacturers make plastics out of synthetic organic polymers, which they source from fossil fuels. Coal, natural gas, and crude oil are the primary materials for making plastic.

            Polyethylene terephthalate is the plastic resin used to make the majority of plastic water bottles. It has been in existence since 1941. A scientist from a chemical company, Du Pont, patented the first PET plastic bottle in 1973, which has since largely come to represent what we know of today as a plastic bottle.</p>

           <p>We may not be able to cancel out bottled water entirely or all the bad things about plastic; however, there are ways to make drinking bottled water sustainable. Below are some things that can help our water consumption habits positively impact the environment.</p>
           <h3>Public Awarness</h3>
           <p>The environmental consequences of plastic water bottles affect everyoneâ€”even eco-conscious people who don't drink bottled water. Individuals, organizations, and governments need to increase efforts to educate the public on the downsides of bottled water.</p>
            <p>Many countries are working on controlling environmental pollution. They have established policies that reduce plastic production and prohibit excessive packaging. Some countries like Kenya have banned single-use plastics. Kenya made using single-use plastics illegal in its territories as of June 2020.

                Bottleless water systems and refill stations have become more popular as councils, governments, and even festivals have recognized we don't need all those plastic bottles.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Plastic water bottles, much like the ubiquitous plastic bag, may seem useful in everyday life, but the environmental impact they produce is unsustainable. The large amount of plastic water bottles we send to landfills and oceans has become a burden on our environment.
